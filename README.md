# plume-visual
Learning tool for atmospheric dispersion
These scripts were designed for an undergraduate course unit on atmospheric pollutant dispersion. 
"plume.py" contains a set of functions for calculating pollutant plume characteristics given various 
input parameters, and functions for graphing plume footprints. Class plume visualizations.ipynb is the 
Jupyter Notebook used to demonstrate the use of the plume.py functions to students in class, and 
"plume-classexamples.py" was copied from the Jupyter Notebook file.
